# 21CardTrick
 
This program generates a random deck of 21 cards (no duplicates) and asks the user to memorize a card from the list.
The program splits the deck into 3 stacks, and asks the user 3 times to identify the stack that their card is in.
The program then correctly identifies which card the user memorized.

Although fairly simple for a computer to calculate, this is a card trick that is much more impressive preformed in person.

How it works is, whatever stack the user chooses, each stack is then placed on top of eachother with the chosen stack always placed in the middle.
The cards are then divided by: first card goes to stack 1, second to stack 2, third to stack 3, fourth to stack 1 etc.
After the third time the user identifies the group, the stacks are reassembled same as previous and the correct card is always the 11th element of the deck.
